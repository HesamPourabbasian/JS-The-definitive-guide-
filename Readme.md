This repository contains **my personal study notes, code examples, and exercises** from reading *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* (7th edition).  
Everything is organized by chapter to match the official book structure.

⚠️ **Important**: These notes are for **personal educational purposes**.  
They are not a replacement for the official book. I highly recommend buying the original O'Reilly book — it's one of the best JavaScript references ever written.
